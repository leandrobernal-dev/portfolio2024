      </h2>
      <p>
        I started out curious about robotics and computers, but eventually fell
        in love with web development. I've been freelancing for about 3 years
        now, building and maintaining websites and web applications for my
        clients.

        In my spare time, I enjoy 3D printing and modeling, or playing
        fingerstyle on my acoustic guitarðŸŽ¸.
