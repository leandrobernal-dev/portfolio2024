            I worked with clients to design and build responsive web
            applications from concept to deployment. I utilized front-end
            technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, alongside
            back-end tools such as Node.js, Express, and databases like MySQL
            and MongoDB. I focused on delivering seamless user experiences,
            implementing API integrations, and optimizing performance, while
            ensuring scalability and security. My work consistently provided
            clients with high-quality, reliable digital solutions tailored to
            their business goals.

            I also learned Google Cloud Platform along the way. Helped clients
